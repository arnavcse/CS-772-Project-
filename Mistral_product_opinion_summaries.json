If you are not looking for a fancy design or so-called premium glass design, then you might be disappointed. Design is elegant and resembles high-end Samsung phones. I purchased an electric black variant and must say I loved it. \ud83d\ude0d The water drop notch is not a deal breaker for me. Display brightness and quality is great, Samsung never disappoints in display. This phone has 6000 Mah battery still it feels light and so comfortable. Battery life is stable and great. When I received this phone, it had 53% battery charge available. I used this from 6 pm to 11 pm, setting up, installing apps from backup, and then watching a movie. The phone ran continuously without getting warm or getting hung. At 11 p.m., the battery remaining after 5 hours of use was 29%. I was so happy. I was worried about the performance of exynos 1280, but I must say this delivers well in the midrange segment. It's consistent and doesn't get warm after normal usage. The main cameras are good, but the other two are average. I would recommend this phone for everyone who wants to purchase a good phone under 20k Rupees. Wait for sale and offers. If you can get it for some discount or with some exchange offer, it may come down to around 15k to 16k, and at this price, this is awesome.\", \"Product is good.

Lts start with the DESIGN *Its awesome. Looks really good in Wight. Slim and sleek , looks premium, with cases too. PERFORMANCE *the snapdragon 695 is an efficiency based chipset. It can squeeze out maximum performance with less battery usage. But it can compete with snapdragon 750g and 778 in performance base too. Only thing missing out is 4k video recording. Gaming is good. I got 60 fps in all the games I tried. It can even run jenshin impact pretty decent , so nothing to discuss more CAMERA *the 50 mp OIS is good. Only if you know how to use it. There are a lot goons out there reviewing that it's bad . It's just they don't know how to use it. The manual mode in camera is good , can shoot decent photos too. But the real thing is taking advantage of the software. You can just install Google cam and can shoot and record like a pixel does. It's awesome I'll share some examples DISPLAY *The 10 bit OLED is a banger. The colours are rich and vibrant. Movie experience is awesome BATTERY *the 5000 mah is an overkill lol. It's been 19 days since I bought it. I ve never charged when battery is under 20% more than once. You can easily use without charging for 2days in a medium usage AUDIO PERFORMANCE * I am big fan of movies and anime. So audio and visual is important to me, it's one of the main reasons why I bought this phone . But im slightly disappointed. I know it's got Dolby. Because of the Dolby got a fixed preset , and we can't adjust the equilizer. . But the audio quality is good though. I used to have a old Lenovo it had Dolby in it . It was better than this. But the Loud speakers are the best. awesome quality and surround sounds . And the haptic feedback is cool. too many block heads said it's vibrating while playing sounds. They probably don't know what's haptic feed back is . HEATING Phone doesn't heat much , only while intense gaming that is. And it's mildly too. The only drawback I saw is bad quality with earphone audio quality. And im statisfied with phone . Worth the money go for it\", 'Very good phone for normal users. 1.Display quality no1 2.battery backup super 3.camera ok not that bad... As reviews 4.sd695 super. 5.android13 update and 3yeras update', \"Superb phone. I think the best combination would be with 8 gb ram. For camera use G Cam Mod, works superb with the hardware provided. Photography experience will become awesome. Battery experience is the best. I always feel what's the point of buying an expensive chip which can't last a half day atleast to experience it. Here the battery will last more than 10 hours, since the chip is working well. Just we have to keep check on what we are installing and what background processes those are invoking. If you keep a track of your settings then nothing will hamper the battery experience. The processor is very nice. I can play cod on high and very high settings with no issues. 2 times out 50 times there could be a lag. But that's it. The rest of the work is smooth enough under it. 8 Gb is the perfect match for it. Software experience is the Selling Point of this phone. Hence, it's smooth, Clean and interesting. 90% optimised. Very very rarely software creates problems. Display is so good ilon the eye. 1080p is good enough for me. I don't watch 2k>= content so no issues.\", 'This is one phone which gives value for money, p oled display looks great, and the camera was awesome. Battery backup was ok but I wish it could be better, turbo charging helps to charge the phone quickly, phone can run on a single charge for the whole day if you are a medium user.', \"Cons\u2935\ufe0f *Only one major Android update is not enough. *The back panel vibrates a lot while playing anything on speaker. *Performance of wide angle camera and micro camera is below zero even main lens is not up to the mark but you can fix it by GoogleCamera Mod *MGC_8.4.600_A10_V13_MGC.apk* Pros\u2935\ufe0f *The user interface is best in the class even better than those phones costing 60k to 70k. *The display is just amazing I know that it won't support HDR Plus and 4K videos Play back but still better than those devices that support 4K and HDR+. *The stereo speaker on this device is just fine not to mention back panel vibration.\", 'Must buy. Very nice product phone performance is very good Awesome screen Good battery life', \"Nice phone with different features. I switched from samsung note 8 to Moto g82. Display looks great and very light to hold. I love it. Battery life looks good Camera is fine but not that great. Overall good phone for regular use. Edited on 3/11/22- Camera is worst in terms of selfie. Can't take pics in night. Could have gone for some other brand \ud83e\udd72\", \"Well apart from the camera being decent, Motorola has a fantastic job with this phone in my opinion. Display is top-notch, battery is top-notch, performance and software experience is top-notch. Stereo speakers are impressive because they do have good bass. These were the only things I was seeking and finding them here being done so perfectly really makes me glad. There really isn't any fault that I could find with it except for the camera; that was a little disappointing because it doesn't feel like a 50MP until you're out in a lot of sunlight however the night vision mode is surprisingly good. The phone is very light and smooth which is again something I personally wanted. All in all, I'm very happy with this device.\", 'Verry good parformance.
