      "    The vivo V25 Pro 5G, priced at Rs. 29400 after a discount from its base price of Rs. 39999, boasts a stunning 16.66 cm (6.56 inch) Full HD+ AMOLED curved display with a quick 120 Hz refresh rate, making it a top choice for multitasking and entertainment. In comparison, the vivo T1 5G, priced at Rs. 15990, offers a 16.72 cm (6.58 inch) FHD in-cell display and a 5000 mAh battery for long-lasting usage. However, the vivo V25 Pro 5G's Mediatek Dimensity 1300 octa-core processor with a primary clock speed of 3 GHz and triple rear camera setup (64MP + 8MP + 2MP) outshine the vivo T1 5G's Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 octa-core processor and triple rear camera setup (50 MP + 2 MP + 2 MP). The vivo V23 5G, priced at Rs. 29990, features a 16.36 cm (6.44 inch) Full HD+ AMOLED display, Mediatek Dimensity 920 octa-core processor, and a triple rear camera setup (64 MP + 8 MP + 2 MP). While the vivo V23 5G's 50 MP + 8 MP dual front camera setup is impressive, the vivo V25 Pro 5G's 32 MP front camera captures mesmerising pictures with outstanding graphics. Ultimately, the vivo V25 Pro 5G's superior processing power, impressive camera capabilities, and long-lasting battery make it the better choice for users seeking a high-performance 5G smartphone with a curved display. The vivo T1 5G, despite its long-lasting battery, lags behind in terms of processing power and camera capabilities. The vivo V23 5G, while offering a high-quality display and impressive front camera, falls short in terms of processing power compared to the vivo V25 Pro 5G.\n",
